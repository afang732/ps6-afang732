#User Documentation


This data shows the top songs on Spotify of 2022. For the Barchart widget, the user is able to select the artist name and see the number of weeks on charts their songs were. The default will show Justin Bieber, Doja Cat, and Adele, but the user can add more artists to display on the chart. The Chart page includes a widget that shows a list of artists, where the user can select the number of weeks on chart and the artist names will show up.
