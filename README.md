#User Documentation
your project: a brief description of the data, and explanation what are the widgets and panels
doing. This file should contain a link to your project on the https://www.shinyapps.io
server.

This data shows the top songs on Spotify of 2022. For the Barchart widget, the user is able to select the artist name and see the number of weeks on charts their songs were. The Chart page includes a widget that shows a visual chart, where the user can select the number of weeks on chart and the artist names will show up. 

note: for some reason the visualizations (barchart and chart) work sometimes, but sometimes they don't appear.
